# üóÑÔ∏è LIS751-SQL_Relational_Database_Project
## ‚òû Introduction
This project is for the mid-term of LIS 751 at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. The task is to create a database from the ground up, and since I am a foodie, I have chosen the "Food Bucket List" database. This platform helps users track, review, and discover food places, with the goal of bringing people together to share food experiences and recommendations.

## ‚òû Project Goals
- **Maintain a list of food stores** including their names, locations, and types, accessible to all users.
- **Track food places** users have visited and those they still want to try.
- **Store users' ratings** for each food store and the dishes they‚Äôve tried.
- **Enable sorting and filtering** by store type, rating, and location for all users.
- **Record users' favorite and recommended dishes** or items at each store.
- **Allow users to share their lists** of food places, ratings, and recommendations with others.
- **Allow food stores to view users' feedback and ratings** for improvement.
- **Automate data collection and reporting** to reduce manual efforts (**auto-updating dashboard** & **daily data fetch** from Amazon Best Sellers Website).
- **Convert data into visual charts** for easier trend analysis and quick issue identification.
